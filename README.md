Nunchuk64
==============
Converter to connect for Wii Nunchuk or Nindendo NES Classic Mini Controller 
to a Commodore 64. The circuit converts two Nintendo Controllers to two 
Commodore 64 ones. Both digital and analog inputs of the Commodore are 
controlled.

This is my very first project designing a PCB with a layouting tool.
I introduced myself into KiCad which satisfed my needs perfectly.
The KiCad project is provided inside subfolder "hardware".

The project is still in progress, because I need to finish the firmware for the 
ATMega328p chip I made us of.

My personal project goals:
--------------
- ☑ learn KiCad design workflow
- ☑ learn how to layout PCBs with SMD parts
- ☑ learn about SMD sizes and package types
- ☑ order a PCB from a professional manufactorer


Dependecies:
--------------
- KiCad to see schematic and layout
- avr-gcc toolchain for compiling the firmware


Milestones:
--------------
- ☑ Tested with "Nindendo NES Classic Mini Controller" replica
- ☐ Analog input like Nunchuk or Analog Gamepad
