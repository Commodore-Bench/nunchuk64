==============

This is my very first project designing a PCB with a layouting tool.
I introduces myself into KiCad which satisfed my needs perfectly.

The project is still in progress, because I need to finish the firmware for the ATMega chip I used.
The PCB prototypes are in production at the moment.

My personal project goals:
--------------
- learn KiCad design workflow
- order a pcb from a professional

Dependecies:
--------------
- KiCad to see schematic and layout
- avr-gcc for compiling the firmware
