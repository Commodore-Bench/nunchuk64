This is my very first project designing a PCB with a layouting tool.
I introduced myself into KiCad which satisfed my needs perfectly.
The KiCad project is provided inside subfolder "hardware".

The project is still in progress, because I need to finish the firmware for the 
ATMega328p chip I made us of.

My personal project goals:
--------------
-☑ learn KiCad design workflow
-☑ learn how to layout PCBs with SMD parts
-☑ learn about SMD sizes and packages types
-☑ order a PCB from a professional manufactorer


Dependecies:
--------------
- KiCad to see schematic and layout
- avr-gcc for compiling the firmware
